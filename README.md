# Social Network API

## The Social Network API stores large amounts of unstructured data in the form of thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.  

## This assignment required the use of Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose which is a Node.js-based Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.  Mongoose generates user id's, thought id's, reaction id's, and friend id's in this application,  

## Insomnia is used to test the routes.
